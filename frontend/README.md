# Development
The webapp is written in Javascript and uses ReactJS (Hooks), along with Redux-Thunk, Router, and a couple of other things.

## Setting up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository after forking.
2. Ensure you have nodeJS and npm installed.
3. Run `npm install` to fetch and install all the necessary packages
4. Run `npm start` to run the frontend development server.
5. Access website at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Contributing

Please make sure that your commit messages are clean and descriptive. An example of such a commit would be:
```
Logout: Add a functional logout button
```
Try to include a commit description that explains your changes in more detail. While it isn't a must, it does smoothen the development process for other contributors.
